        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey there! I'm a full-stack Java developer with a passion for writing clean, efficient code. 
            I'm a graduate of the super competitive bootcamp program at School of Applied Technology in Stockholm, 
            where I learned how to turn my love for OOP and TDD into a career.I'm not just a coder though, 
            I've got mad problem-solving skills and a keen eye for detail. Plus, my background in Tourism Management has taught me 
            how to navigate different cultures and communicate effectively with all types of people.
            So, if you're looking for a driven, adaptable, and all-around awesome full-stack developer, give me a call!</p>
